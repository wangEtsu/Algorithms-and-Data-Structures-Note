1. Searching Algorithm

2. Linear Search
Loop through the entire array and find the target

3. BIG O Linear Search
 - Best O(1) Might find in the first one
 - Worst O(n) Might find in the last one
 - But Over all, the complexity is O(n)

4. Binary search 
 - It use the idea of Divide and Conquer
 - It's way faster
 - It only works in sorted array

5. BIG O Binary Search
 - Best O(1)
 - Worst O(log n) It's really good, almost like O(1)

6. Naive String Search
