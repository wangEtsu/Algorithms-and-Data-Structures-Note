1. Intermediate Sorting Algorithms
Following episode will include:
 - Merge Sort
 - Quic Sort
 - Radix Sort

2. Why?
 Bubble/Insertion/Selection Sort does well in small dataset, but doesn't in large dataset

3. Merge Sort
It has a time complexity of O(nlogn), comparing to O(n^2) of bubble Sort
! There's a tradeoff between Simplicity and Efficiency

4. Dive into Merge Sort
Arrays of 0 / 1 element are already sorted: [3], [5]..
Merge sort works by decomposing an array into smaller arrays of 0/1 elements
It's Divide and Conquer
Splitting up -> Merging
